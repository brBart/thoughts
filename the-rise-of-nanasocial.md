The Rise of Nanosocial
----------------------

From what I learned as a Yo user and then from [copying Yo in Switzerland](https://github.com/harryf/thoughts/blob/master/hoi-and-yo.md), I'm going to come out and say it...

**Yo is a game changer for social**.

### More than meets the eye

As a user, you quickly discover that, despite no ability to modify the message payload, it is in fact a powerful messaging tool. Sending someone you care about a "Yo" at 7am or at 11pm is an intimate experience. Sending a work colleague that's waiting to start a meeting with you a "Yo" 1 minute before it starts tells them you haven't forgotten. In fact some say there are [30 types of Yo](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-yo-app-is-going-viral--here-are-30-types-of-yos-2014-6).

What makes Yo work as a form of communication is not _what's_ being said, but _when_ it's being said and _who_ it's being said to. You might argue [Swawm](https://www.swarmapp.com/) does the same but adds location to the context-mix.


### The 1% Rule

We've known for [some time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) that only 1% of any given internet community actually engages in it by contibuting content. All optimizations, tricks and tools aside, how are we going to engage with the majority of our users if [90% of them are lurkers](http://community.lithium.com/t5/Science-of-Social-blog/The-90-9-1-Rule-in-Reality/ba-p/5463)? The answer is we aren't. Not if that engagement relies on getting them to share _content_...


### Context is King

What we learnt from [Hoi](http://gethoi.ch) and copying [copying Yo](https://github.com/harryf/thoughts/blob/master/hoi-and-yo.md) is we can reach more than just 90% of our users by asking them to share _context_ not content. That is what Yo so brilliantly achieves. By eliminating cognitive burden of _what_ we want to say or the delay that taking an uploading a picture entails, Yo enables us to share **context** with our friends. Many times that manages to be a _more_ compelling and intimate experience, removing the "bragging" dimension that networks based on content sharing suffer from.


### Nanosocial

So what is this thing? We're calling it **nanosocial**.

Nanosocial is characterized by the sharing of [contextual and spatial presence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_contextual_awareness). It does not rely on content, on text, pictures or video. It does not even rely on social graphs. It's prime user experience is the exchange of a _moment_ between two participants.

There is no need to solidify this thing around building up numbers of friends or followers, timelines, preferences and statuses. It is by it's very nature temporal and that's why it works so well.


### Nanosocial is the future of push advertising

Meanwhile Yo is [this close](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/pointless-yo-app-now-alerts-israelis-to-rocket-attacks/) to figuring out how to make push messaging an effective tool for broadcasting. By combining the tool with a specific context, such as [a sporting event](http://www.ibtimes.com/yo-app-world-cup-feature-alerts-users-when-goals-are-scored-1608964), we have the perfect mix for advertisers; opt-in instead of spam and open rates as [we learned](https://github.com/harryf/thoughts/blob/master/hoi-and-yo.md) of 30-40%
