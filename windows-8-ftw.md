So after [betting](https://twitter.com/hfuecks/status/260831014442643456), three reasons why this could work...

The first signs of Apple fatigue are here
-----------------------------------------

Oh sure iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini are great products. But part of what Apple sells us is dreams of the future. And the current dream is ... well not so new any more. Meanwhile Windows 8 and the Metro UI plus the Surface is a great tablet experience. It's distinct to iOS, consistent and fast. A real alternative the way Android isn't.

So Microsoft might just have got lucky with their timing, despite the iPad Mini launch.

Real work... but on a tablet
----------------------------

I've played with iPads, Googles Nexus, Samsungs Galaxy and Galaxy Note and Blackberry's Playbook. They're _all_ very sexy devices but if we're honest, only for _passive_ activities; reading, watching videos, playing games... consuming. Creating presentation, working with spreadsheets, inviting a bunch of people to an event, programming and generally being creative still happen on a laptop for all but the fanatical.

So what if your tablet allowed you to be both a passive consumer and a productive worker?

Microsoft is right about the Surface's keyboard. Of course the solution elsewhere is [1 accessory away](https://shop.digitec.ch/en/logitech-ultrathin-keyboard-cover-fuer-ipad-schwarz-e-book-reader-tablet-computer-accessory-363903) but we want this stuff out of the box. And it runs deeper than that...

Today's tablet OS's lack things like real multi-tasking, copying and pasting or anything "serious" e.g. images and that stuff we take for granted on a laptop to do "real work".

Windows 8 and the Surface are capable of being play _and_ work. In my opinion that makes Microsoft the first to nail this one on a tablet device. It means if I buy one, _I can ditch my laptop at last_...

The signs are looking ... well better
-------------------------------------

Much has been written that Microsoft is taking a huge risk with Windows 8; that of alienating their enterprise customers. You might say it's an insane risk and you might be right but you can't make innovative _and_ successful products without risk. The point here is _change_; Microsoft must have undergone some radical internal transformations to risk it's flagship on this kind of gambit.

Windows 8 - the end result - looks polished and was apparently accomplished in the space of a year, from the time of the first developer preview. That implies people behind it with a talent for execution, a desire to get stuff done. You can do amazing things with those kind of people...

Of course Microsoft could still get it horribly wrong making me horribly wrong. When I consider the back story on a little detail like the broken download link on [this page](http://info.local.ch/directories/mobile/windows-phone-7), there's certainly a _lot_ left to do. But I'm betting lucky timing, a real use case and great people can turn this one around...
